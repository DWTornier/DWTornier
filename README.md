# Profile  

 
I am Tornier, an Illustrator trying to develop games.  
There is still a lot for me to learn about 3DCG, any suggestion is appreciated!  

## Technical Art  
- [Custom Celshading models for UnrealEngine](https://github.com/DWTornier/UnrealEngine) (You have to join [Epic Games](github.com/EpicGames) to access it)  
- [Yui Hirasawa 3D Model - Fan Art](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/a0YxyX)  
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/677aa7ee-1cbc-435b-a079-7a2fadeaaa4b" width="400" />  
    I referenced some K-ON official art (mainly Horiguchi Yukiko and Yamada Naoko's) to create it.
- [Deserts of K-ON! - Fan Art](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/rJW6Q2)  
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b4fa952-0630-4213-99bc-a2279b177276" width="400" />  
    Contains a planet view that is fully implemented with material nodes.
- [Daten City - Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt Fan Art](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/Ny8LK1)  
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7fc1319-06be-4439-b8b5-b72a6eb12037" width="400" />  
    A procedural sci-fi city made entirely of material nodes, [here is the process](youtube.com/shorts/kjVNjXVwGIg).
## Illustration  
  Most of my illustrations are K-ON! fan art somehow.
